# Exam Intelligence Logic (Conceptual)

## Decision rules
- Time-weighting: closer exams get higher weight; within 3–5 days focus narrowly on high-yield topics and weak areas; beyond a week balance coverage and spaced review.
- Coverage vs. weakness: surface weak concepts first; keep a few strong but high-yield topics to prevent forgetting.
- Source priority: emphasize instructor-signaled topics (syllabus, review sheets, emphasized slides); de-prioritize low-yield or redundant notes.
- Recency and spacing: resurface items not reviewed recently; shorten intervals for weak items, lengthen for mastered ones.
- Session sizing: fit to available time (20/40/60 minutes) blending drills and brief recaps.
- Format choice: near-exam favors short-answer/recall; farther out uses mixed MCQ/flashcards and concept linking.
- Stop conditions: if mastery is consistent, reduce frequency; if misses persist, insert mini-explanations before further drills.

## Example responses
- “Your CS midterm is in 4 days. Start with recursion and DP—the weakest areas from your last quiz. I’ll give 8 short-answer drills, then a 5-minute recap on memoization patterns.”
- “Today’s 30-minute plan for Psych: 10 flashcards on conditioning, 6 short-answer on reinforcement schedules (you missed 3 yesterday), finish with a 3-minute summary of lecture 5 highlights.”
- “You’ve mastered derivatives but still slow on integrals. With the exam next week, let’s do 5 integrals with u-substitution, then 3 mixed applications, then a quick formula review.”
- “History exam is tomorrow. Focus on the Reconstruction policies you missed twice and the Supreme Court cases likely to appear; I’ll run 6 rapid-fire prompts and a 2-minute summary.”
- “You’re solid on probability basics; weak on Bayes applications. Exam in 9 days: today we’ll alternate 6 applied problems with brief concept checks to shore up Bayes.”
